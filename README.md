### Disruptive solutions for enterprise problems
###### A fictional software company

#### About us & the Problem
- We are a group of PUCRS students and we were challenged to create a fictitious software company to solve a problem of a real company. We are a group of 6 students:
  - Augusto Sopelsa Klaic (@AugustoKlaic)
  - Diovane Monteiro
  - Nei Cardoso
  - Henrique Marques
  - Nicolas Curco
  - Cassiano
- We came up with the company **CATTLE+**, we are focus to solve the problem that Vakinha bring to us, that is basically take the information they already have and filter and trsnform that in a more valueable information.

#### Our solution
 - After receiving the proposal we thought about using the info they have and help the users of the web site Vakinha, making the usage and the understanding more easy from the user perspective. Our solution is focused in give power and control to the users over their crowd funding proposals.
 
***The group proposed the following:***
  1. Develop and deliver a backend solution in pyhton;
  2. Using micro-services to facilitate the integration in Vakinha archtecture;
  3. Cloud hostage;
  4. User oriented solution;
