### Disruptive solutions for enterprise problems
###### A fictional software company

#### About us & the Problem
- We are a group of PUCRS students and we were challenged to create a fictitious software company to solve a problem of a real company. We are a group of 5 students:
  - Augusto Sopelsa Klaic (@AugustoKlaic)
  - Diovane Monteiro
  - Nei Cardoso
  - Henrique Marques
  - Nicolas Curco
  
- We came up with the company **CATTLE+**, we are focus to solve the problem that Vakinha bring to us, that is basically take the information they already have and filter and trsnform that in a more valueable information.

#### Our solution
 - After receiving the proposal we thought about using the info they have and help the users of the web site Vakinha, making the usage and the understanding more easy from the user perspective. Our solution is focused in give power and control to the users over their crowd funding proposals.
 
***The group proposed the following:***
  1. Develop and deliver a backend solution in pyhton;
  2. Using micro-services to facilitate the integration in Vakinha architecture;
  3. Cloud hostage;
  4. User oriented solution;

#### How to see DataBase Structure & Infos:
  1. Git clone the project or with you already have cloned just pull the modifications;
  2. Go to the folder that you saved the changes or pulled the changes;
  3. Open/run the index.html file with a browser to navigate through the databse Info;
  
#### DataBase development
  -We received an entire dump file from vakinha to use it as datasource for our software solution. We treat the database as a priority because it might be the most important part to Vakinha. So we focus in solve all databases problems first, and we had some:
  1. How to send the dump file to the AWS EC2 linux;
  2. How we create the database from the dump;
  3. The dump came up with all users from vakinha;
  
-After solving all of this we had setted the databse full operational, and started the development of the SQL scripts:
